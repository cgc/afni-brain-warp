### BRAIN warp

This Flywheel gear warps the `warp_target` from standard-space into native-space. The standard and native are both supplied as flywheel files.

The `align.csh` script comes from the [D99 Macaque Atlas scripts](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/atlases/macaque/macaqueatlas_1.2a/AFNI_scripts/).
